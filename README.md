## Project Description

BlueSpace is a mental health support platform specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by college students, particularly international and first-year students. These students often experience feelings of isolation, academic stress, and difficulties in adjusting to a new cultural environment.

Our platform offers a variety of mental health resources tailored to help users overcome these challenges:

- **Music and Movie Recommendations**: Personalized suggestions to uplift users' moods and provide a sense of comfort.
- **Drawing Canvas**: A space for creative expression, allowing users to visually express their emotions.
- **Virtual Friend Bot**: A conversational bot designed to offer supportive conversations and listen to users' concerns.
- **Journal**: A secure and private space for users to document their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

In addition to these features, BlueSpace provides access to university resources, such as articles, videos, and well-being activities. The platform facilitates anonymous peer conversations and social interactions through group chats and events, helping students forge new connections and feel supported.

## Features

- **Multi-language support**: The platform accommodates students from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds by offering content in multiple languages.
- **Personalized dashboard**: Tailored to users’ mental health needs, offering recommended content, well-being activities, and progress tracking.
- **Chatbot interface**: Users can engage with the platform’s virtual friend bot for casual or mental health support conversations.
- **Calendar and event sign-up**: Students can register for social events, mental health workshops, and university club activities, with personalized reminders.
- **Group chat and peer support**: Users can join interest-based group chats for peer support and shared experiences.
- **Mental health resource library**: A wide range of articles, videos, and podcasts related to mental health topics such as academic stress, cultural adjustment, and more.
